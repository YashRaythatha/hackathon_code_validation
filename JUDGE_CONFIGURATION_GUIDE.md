## 🛠️ How to Use

### **Step 1: Access Judge Configuration**
1. Navigate to `/judge-config` in your web browser
2. You'll see the Judge Configuration interface

### **Step 2: Choose Configuration Method**

#### **Option A: Use Presets**
1. Click on one of the preset buttons (Tech Focus, UI/UX Focus, etc.)
2. The weights will be automatically applied
3. Review and adjust if needed

#### **Option B: Custom Configuration**
1. Manually adjust the percentage sliders for each criteria
2. Ensure the total equals 100%
3. The interface will show real-time validation

### **Step 3: Save and Apply**
1. Click "Save Configuration" to store your settings
2. Click "Apply & Test" to activate the configuration
3. The system will now use your custom weights for all evaluations

## 📊 Weight Calculation Examples

### **Example 1: Tech Focus Hackathon**
```
Selected Agents: Code Analysis, Architecture, Technical Complexity
Weights: 25%, 20%, 20% (total: 65%)

Final Score Calculation:
- Code Analysis: 8/10 × 25% = 2.0 points
- Architecture: 7/10 × 20% = 1.4 points  
- Technical: 9/10 × 20% = 1.8 points
- Total: 5.2 points out of 6.5 possible = 8/10
```

### **Example 2: UI/UX Focus Hackathon**
```
Selected Agents: UI/UX Analysis, UI/UX Polish, Functionality
Weights: 30%, 25%, 20% (total: 75%)

Final Score Calculation:
- UI/UX: 9/10 × 30% = 2.7 points
- UI/UX Polish: 8/10 × 25% = 2.0 points
- Functionality: 7/10 × 20% = 1.4 points
- Total: 6.1 points out of 7.5 possible = 8/10
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **1. Align with Hackathon Goals**
- **Innovation hackathons**: Prioritize creativity and novelty
- **Technical hackathons**: Focus on code quality and architecture
- **Design hackathons**: Emphasize UI/UX and visual polish
- **Social impact**: Balance functionality with innovation

### **2. Consider Participant Level**
- **Beginner hackathons**: Lower technical complexity weights
- **Expert competitions**: Higher technical and architecture weights
- **Mixed levels**: Balanced approach with clear criteria

### **3. Time Constraints**
- **24-hour hackathons**: Focus on functionality and basic quality
- **Weekend hackathons**: Include more comprehensive evaluation
- **Multi-week competitions**: Full evaluation with all criteria

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Configuration Storage**
```python
# Configuration is stored in judge_config.json
{
  "weights": {
    "code_analysis": 25,
    "architecture": 20,
    "technical": 20,
    "functionality": 15,
    "innovation": 10,
    "security": 5,
    "ui_ux": 5,
    "ui_ux_polish": 0,
    "learning": 0
  },
  "total_percentage": 100,
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### **API Endpoints**
```python
# Get current configuration
GET /api/judge-config

# Update configuration
POST /api/judge-config
{
  "weights": {
    "code_analysis": 25,
    "architecture": 20,
    // ... other weights
  }
}
```

### **Integration with AI Grader**
```python
# Initialize grader with judge configuration
judge_config = JudgeConfig()
grader = AIGrader(judge_config=judge_config)

# Weights are automatically applied during evaluation
results = grader.grade(repo_url, selected_agents=['1', '2', '3'])
```
